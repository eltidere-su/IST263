              <h2>What is Beacon Technology in the Retail Context?</h2>
              <p>  Beacon technology has enabled retailers to enhance the store expereince they provide for their customers. Beacons utilize bluetooth technology to send messages from the beacon to a mobile device within the specified range. Beacons have been used recently in retail to send messages to customers roaming around the store. The messages might contain a promotion pertaining to the pair of jeans the customer recently looked at online or details of an upcoming store event. The customer must have the store's app open in order to receive the alerts. </p> 
              <p>According to Swirl Networks Inc., "over 70% of shoppers say beacon-triggered content and offers increased their likelihood to purchase in-store". Many retailers have already begun using beacon technology to enhcance the expereince for their customers and to ensure they are not falling behind the trends. Some of these stores include Macy's, Urban Outfitters, and CVS.  </p>
              <p> The tricky thing with new technologies, like beacon technology, is that companies have to get innovative with the ways they utilize it. Companies have the opportunity to become innovative and brainstorm new ways to utlize beacons in their stores but, if they are followers, it could be hard for them to catch up with competitors. </p>

              <h2>Different Ways Beacon Technology is Being Used in Retail</h2>
              <p>One common use for beacons in retail is to help customers navigate the store. This use is especially seen in large stores. Beacons can be used to create a navigaion feature on a store's mobile application that can help customers find a certain item or simply to shop around.</p>
              <p>A key piece of properly setting up stores effectively is having accurate traffic data. Beacons enable retailers to track traffic patterns throughout their stores. When managers know the locations of the store that see the most traffic, they can subsequently set their store up to improve conversion rates. A manager might choose to put their most popular item in the location that gets the most traffic. Conversely, if a certain area of the store is getting more traffic, it might indicate the popularity of a certain item. Additioanlly, the traffic patterns can be used to indicate how many associates should be staffed on the sales floor at certain times of the day.</p>
              <p>An additional key component to a beacon retail technology strategy is the ability for retailers to send their customers targeted discounts and promotional alerts. A customer could be looking at a  pair of jeans and then be alerted with a message that states that all sweaters are $10 off with the purchase of a pair of jeans. This taregtted notification is strategically sent to people who are already considering purchasing the jeans in hopes they will spend more money on the sweater. </p>
