              <p> Hello! My name is Elena Tiderencel and I am a senior at Syracuse University. I am majoring in Marketing Management and Entrepreneruship and Emerging Enterprises with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am in the Ren√©e Crown University Honors Program and have been thinking about my senior thesis since freshman year. It was not until the summer before senior year that I confirmed what I wanted to do. </p>
              <p> I interned at Deloitte in consulting the summer before senior year. I became involved in an internal project called the "Connected Stores". Deloitte's Connected Store is their vision of the where retail is going and what is trending right now. It creates a customer-centric store experience utilizng all of the latest technologies. </p>
              <p> This project was an incredle learning expereince for me. I learned a lot about the topic and developed a passion for the latest retail technologies. The porject combined all of my areas of study so my education complimented the expereince as well. </p>
              <p> As soon as I developed this passion, I knew it would be a wonderful topic to choose for my Honors Thesis. I studied the business and strategy side of the topic this summer. I figured it would be beneficial to better understand the latest technologies and how they really work. </p>
              <p> I signed my offer to return to Deloitte after I graduate in May of 2020. This project will help me to become more knowledgeable about the topic. When I return to Deloitte I will have more to offer when it comes to the Connected Store. </p>
              <p> Through my research, I have learned an incredible amount of new information about the latest technological trends in retail and I am excited to share my findings with you! </p>
